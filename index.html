                <h2>About you gem </h2>
                 <h5>Okay, let's talk about you. First and foremost, you are like a precious gem.
                    Beyond being someone's son, friend, or boyfriend, you are a human being. You are not
                     ordinary; you are a person with exceptional qualities. I'm not claiming you are perfect,
                    as no one is, but for me you are imperfectly perfect. infact i would say you are the bestest person
                     i have ever met because you care about people which is unexpected in this mean world.
                      <br>
                        Why am I saying this? You are imperfectly perfect because I find every thought
                         and every point resonating perfectly with me. You are truly a precious gem,
                         and I believe those who know you will undoubtedly say the same.

                Now, let's talk about you and me, and what you mean to me. Baby, 
                it's not easy to express my love
                 for you in just a few words, but I will do my best to
                  convey the depth of my feelings.
                <br>
                  <hr>
                When we first met, I never imagined that we would form such a precious bond.
                 You've proven to be such a kind and wonderful person. From the moment we 
                 started talking. You are the dream boy 
                 I've always envisioned. I've always wished for a boyfriend who could love me 
                 the way you do, care for me like you do, and take care of me as you have. 
                 <br>
                 I feel incredibly lucky to have you in my life. 
                 <br>
                 And when you talk about visiting devotional places with me,
                  it truly brings peace to my heart.
